# 🌊 Flood Monitoring and Alerting System using IoT

An IoT-based project designed to monitor water levels in real time and generate alerts during potential flood conditions. This system aims to reduce flood-related damage by providing early warnings using sensors and microcontrollers.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Floods cause severe damage to life, property, and infrastructure every year. Traditional flood monitoring systems are often manual and slow. This project provides an automated, real-time flood monitoring and alerting solution using IoT technology.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Continuous monitoring of water levels  
- Early detection of flood conditions  
- Real-time alert generation  
- Low-cost and efficient flood monitoring solution  

---

## ⚙️ System Overview
The system uses a water level sensor connected to a microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32). Sensor data is continuously monitored and compared with predefined threshold levels. When the water level exceeds the threshold, an alert is triggered.

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. Water level sensor measures the water level  
2. Microcontroller reads sensor data  
3. Data is processed and compared with threshold values  
4. Alert is generated when danger level is reached  
5. Data can be visualized on a web dashboard (optional)

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements
- ESP8266 / ESP32  
- Water Level Sensor / Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires  
- OLED Display 

---

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE  
- C ++ Programming  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dashboard – optional)  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Connect the water level sensor to ESP8266/ESP32  
2. Open `flood_monitoring.ino` in Arduino IDE  
3. Select the correct board and COM port  
4. Upload the code to the microcontroller  
5. Power the system and observe water level readings  
6. Open the web dashboard (if implemented)
