# 🌊 Flood Monitoring and Alerting System using IoT

## 📌 Project Overview
The Flood Monitoring and Alerting System is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor water levels in real time and provide early alerts to reduce flood risks and improve disaster response.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor water levels continuously
- Provide real-time flood alerts
- Reduce damage caused by floods
- Support disaster management systems

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino / ESP8266
- Water Level Sensor / Ultrasonic Sensor
- GSM / Wi-Fi Module
- Buzzer / Alert System
- Embedded C
- IoT Platform

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The system uses sensors to measure water levels.  
When the water level crosses a predefined threshold, the system triggers an alert through buzzer/SMS/cloud notification, enabling quick response and preventive action.
